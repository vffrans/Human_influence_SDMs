# Human_influence_SDMs
This is the R project folder for the article entitled, "Gaps and opportunities in modeling human influence on species distributions," by Veronica F. Frans and Jianguo Liu. For further information, please see the corresponding research article in Nature Ecology and Evolution.

The CSV files in the data folder are inputs for running each script (note that these are in Rmarkdown format). PDF versions of the R scripts are also enclosed.

This project was run using R version 4.3.0.

The following are detailed descriptions for each R script:

**Frans_Liu_2024_Human_influence_SDMs_SI_Rscript_1**

This is the first R script of the literature review.
The following is accomplished:
  * Upload of Web of Science search results and cleaning of records
  * Abstract screening
  * Export of articles assigned for full article screening

**Frans_Liu_2024_Human_influence_SDMs_SI_Rscript_2**

This is the second R script of the literature review and synthesis.
The following is accomplished:
  * Upload of full article screening data field description table
  * PRISMA framework summary
  * Overview of themes and word associations
  * Full article screening data cleanup for taxa, domain, and study focus and summary
  * Summary counts of species modeled
  * Summary of human vs. environmental predictor use
  * Summary of qualitative evaluations of human predictor performance

**Frans_Liu_2024_Human_influence_SDMs_SI_Rscript_3**

This is the third R script of the literature review and synthesis.
The following is accomplished:
  * Cleanup, simplification, and synthesis of human predictor names across articles
  * Summary of predictor use across articles, categories, and data types
  * Summary of ambiguous predictors
  * Summary of buffered predictors
  * Summary of study vs. human predictor time frames
  * Plot of fist and last (most recent) years of predictor use
 * CSV file export of predictor name list

**Frans_Liu_2024_Human_influence_SDMs_SI_Rscript_4**

This is the fourth R script of the literature review and synthesis.
The following is accomplished:
  * Summary of study area scales across articles
  * Maps of study countries for all articles, taxa, domain, and study focus
  * Maps with frequency of studies across spatial scales
  * Maps of first published years of human predictor use across spatial scales
  * Maps showing frequency of predictors across spatial scales
  * Cleanup and summary of SDM algorithms used across articles
  * Export of CSV file for the systematic review (supplementary material for publication)

**Frans_Liu_2024_Human_influence_SDMs_SI_Rscript_5**

This is the fifth and last R script of the literature review and synthesis.
The following is accomplished:
  * Matching of predictor names with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
  * Summary of predictor use across SDGs and papers
  * Plots of SDGs by paper and predictor
  * Final export of predictor list with SDGs included
